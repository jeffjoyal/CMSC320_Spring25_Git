Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: It allows for easy collaboration with a large group of people, as well as providing a great framework
		for easy synchronization of various codebases.


Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: The Machine Learning Industry has huge use for data science, because a lot of the field involves
		feeding huge amounts of data to a machine learning model in order for it to learn patterns
		from that data.



Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging branches preserves the branch edit history and creates a merge commit. Looking at the merge
		history you can see exactly what changes were done on what branches, and that history stays
		intact. Meanwhile rebasing copies over all the history in one branch to another, creating a
		more linear work history without messier merge commits.

		Merging is better when collaborating with others, as changes by people can be tracked, and 
		rebasing could copy and change other people's history, leading to confusion.


Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Answer: I'm looking forward to the Pandas and SQL languages and syntax that I'm going to learn in this class,
		because I'm don't have too much experience with that, and it will be super helpful for any
		data science I'll have to do in the future.
